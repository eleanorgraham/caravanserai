<h3>Sensory Friendly Concert - Caravanserai: Mozart’s Gran Partita </h3>
<p><i>Music:</i> Mozart’s Gran Partita (click <a target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/LBjDdKdq_tQ">here</a> for sample of music)</p>
<p>Come hear the 12 wind instruments and double bass serenade you. While each instrument sings and dances in different characters, the combined sound is never too startling. This is a sensory and family friendly concert, where spaces for quiet activities and dancing are provided for everyone. Caravanserai is joined by musicians from James Madison University and Waynesboro Symphony to form our biggest chamber group yet. Admission is free with free-will donation to help us expand into a chamber orchestra.</p>
<p><i>Time:</i> Sunday, February 23, 2020 at 5pm at Trinity Episcopal Church, 214 W Beverley St, Staunton, VA 24401</p>
